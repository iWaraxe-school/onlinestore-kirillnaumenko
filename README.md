## 0. Intro

While going through this training you will develop console `online store`. Each next task will append some functionality or flexibility to it; 

Each task has a description and materials, it doesn't mean that you should read this or only these materials,
Â you are free to 'google' topics and select the most preferable content.
 
### Process 
A trainee must read and understand all materials related to the task and then complete all requirements from the task file.

A link to the pull request must be sent to the trainer via Email or Teams. 
The trainer performs the code review, a trainee must update code according to the comments from 
the code review and then inform his/her trainer that additional code review is required in the 
scope of the same pull request. 

### Administrative part
A trainee is obligated to inform his trainer about vacations or other activities, which will stop training process for 1 week and more. If there is no obstacles, then it is advised to complete at least one task per week (depends on the task scope). If a trainee is assigned on a project, then he/she should work on the training in his/her own time. Training must be completed in < 3 months. If training takes > 3 months, then situation will be reviewed individually (continue or stop the training and find the cause of a slow progress). 
If a trainee has difficulties, then he/she can ask the trainer for advice or a hint (only about the task itself). The final task is the end of the training. Basing on this task the trainer forms feedback for stakeholders, therefore a trainee works on it without any help.

We will store source code of our `OnlineStore` in GitHub. Before start, you should read and 
understand git principals and main git commands.

- Give it a name like `01git`, or `task1-git`, or anything suitable.
- Change something in this newly created branch. For example, add a couple of lines into README.md file, or add a new file, or delete existing one.
- Create a pull request from your branch to main branch, and assign it to your trainer. 
Do not merge it yourself!
